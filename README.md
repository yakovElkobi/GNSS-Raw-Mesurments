# GNSS-Raw-Mesurments
## Description:
This assignment focuses on the basic principles of GNSS, in particular, you are asked to implement a naive positioning algorithm based on RMS (Root Mean Square) of selected (i.e., weighted) pseudo-ranges
## Technolegies:
Our code works with Python language.
## Getting Started:
```
$ https://github.com/yakovElkobi/GNSS-Raw-Mesurments.git
```
Run the command in the terminal
```
$ python3 main.py
```
## Enter the path to the GNSS log-file.txt

After running the program you will get two outputs in the same folder <br>
the first file kml and the second file st_file.csv <br>
in st_file the first table
